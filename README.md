SensorSync-BLE

Overview

SensorSync-BLE is a complex project designed to retrieve temperature and humidity data from sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The collected data is displayed in a mobile application using graphical representations. Additionally, the data is stored in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas and can also be accessed via a desktop interface (IHM) as an alternative.

Features

BLE Communication: Uses the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 BLE expansion board for data transmission.

Mobile App: Built with React Native, visualizes temperature and humidity data in real-time graphs.

Cloud Storage: Data is stored securely in MongoDB Atlas.

Desktop IHM: Provides an alternative interface to access and visualize sensor data.

Complexity: This project is technically challenging and requires an in-depth understanding of BLE communication, cloud storage, and application development.

Technologies Used

Embedded System: STM32 microcontroller with X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 BLE module.

Mobile Application: Developed with React Native for real-time data visualization.

Cloud Database: MongoDB Atlas for data storage.

Desktop Interface: Additional IHM for data access.

Getting Started

Hardware Setup

Connect the temperature and humidity sensors to the STM32 microcontroller.

Attach the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 BLE module for wireless data transmission.

Software Setup

Flash the firmware onto the STM32 microcontroller.

Install the mobile application to view data.

Set up the cloud database in MongoDB Atlas.

Install the desktop IHM for alternative access.
